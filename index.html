  <h1>WP1 Setting up my planning site</h1>
  <h2>1) BRAINSTORM</h2>
  <p><strong> Objectives </strong><p>
    <p>For students who need information for coming up community service opportunitues.</p>
  <p><strong>What problem are we trying to solve?</strong></p>
    <p>Since the the communty service club has not much time to do announce the events in assembly, we thought of trying to solve this problem - lack of advertisement/announcement
    <p>The members always need to find the students to join, instead of the students coming to us</p>
<h2><strong>Questions</strong></h2>
    <p1>1.Who will be the audience for your website?</p1>
    <p>AIS high school students</p>
    <p2>2.What will be the specific purpose of your website?</p2>
    <p>to announce new upcoming events to students</p>
    <p3>3.Who is the client?</p3>
    <p>Mrs. Salma (The teacher in charge of the Community Service Club)</p>
    <p4>4.What are the objectives for the project?</p4>
    <p>-To announce upcoming events</p>
    <p>-Make easier for students to sign up</p>
    <p5>5.What is the Success Criteria/Checklist?</p5>
