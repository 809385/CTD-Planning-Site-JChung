  <h1>WP1 Setting up my planning site</h1>
  <h2>1) BRAINSTORM</h2>
  <p><strong> Objectives </strong><p>
    <p>For students who need information for coming up community service opportunitues.</p>
    <p>let students sign up events on their own</p>
    <p>Make easier to organize and keep track of the community service hours.</p>
  <p><strong>What problem are we trying to solve?</strong></p>
    <p>Since the the communty service club has not much time to do announce the events in assembly, we thought of trying to solve this problem - lack of advertisement/announcement
    <p>The members always need to find the students to join, instead of the students coming to us</p>       
<h3><strong>Questions</strong></h3>

 <h2>Ideas:</h2>
  <p> For AIS Clubs who are needing websites</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A website for Community Service Club

    <ul>
      <li>AUDIENCE: Students</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>PURPOSE: announcements for new events and give info to students who want to join</ul>
      </li>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>A website for Prom committee Club
      <ul>
        <li>AUDIENCE: Students</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>PURPOSE: Upload information for Prom. (Date, deposit money)</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>FLOWCHART</strong></h4>

<h5><strong>STEP1:WIREFRAMES</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>WIREFRAME->STORYCHART->PROTOTYPE</li></ul>
<p><strong>Idea 1</strong></p>
<img src="WIREFRAME%201-2.png"></a>
<p><strong>Idea 2</strong></p>
<img src="WIREFRAME%202-2.png"></a>
<p>For this wireframe I tried to put the sign up button as the action button so I put it right in the middle so it is easier for students to see and so it is the first thing they see when they go into the website.</p>
<p><strong>Idea 3</strong></p>
<img src="Screen%20Shot%202015-01-14%20at%209.49.55%20AM.png"></a>
<p>For the the third wireframe I did something similar as the second idea but I put more pictures on the bottom and replace some boxes.</p>

<p6><strong>Final Wireframe:</strong></p6>
<ul>
    <li>Our group chose to do the first Wireframe we created since it fit the most with what our client wanted. When people look at websites they tend to look at the left corner and the top line. So we decided to put the most important things in that place. We placed the sign up button on the left end and our website name on the top. Moreover, we chose to put the photos in the middle so it would attract our audience when looking at the websites. </li>
</ul>
