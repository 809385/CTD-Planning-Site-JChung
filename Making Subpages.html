<h3>LOOK AND FEEL OF THE SUBPAGES</h3>
<p><strong>Why is the Look and Feel of the website important?</strong></p>
<p>It is important because it instantly conveys an attitude to clients</p>
<p>Every website has a different purpose and the look and feel of it would help this client to achieve their purpose and who their audience are.</p>
<p>It's like a &quot;personality,&quot; which matches up with what the client wants</p>
<p><strong>Our Theme: A good look and feel of our website could be...</strong></p>
<ul><li>Approachable</li>
<li>Friendly</li>
<li>Experienced</li>
<li>w/ some Consistent parts (Too much consistency can create confusion to the audience because they don't notice when the page is changed.)</li></ul>
<p><strong>Our Final Website LOOK AND FEEL is going to be..</strong></p>
<p><strong>Color of background:</strong> White</p>
<p><strong>Logo: </strong>strong&gt;The AIS Logo will help meet the client's objective..This Logo will make the audience (AIS HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS) recognize that this is for them to access and sign up for their school events. The students will be able to get who this site is for.</p>
<p><strong>Size: </strong>The size of the sign up sheet would be the biggest, since that is our purpose of making this site for our client.</p>
<p><strong>Tone:</strong> It would be friendly since it is for the AIS students who are willing to help people in the community</p>


<p>The followings are some other community service sites that I have found:</p>
<img src="Screen%20Shot%202015-05-12%20at%207.41.06%20PM.png" height ="300px" />
<img src="Screen%20Shot%202015-05-12%20at%207.41.29%20PM.png" height ="300px" />

<p>I wanted to make this site as a scholarly feel.As I looked through different types and different organizations community service site, they also had a friendly and a scholarly feel.So what I did was to make the fonts as a scholarly theme and as if it is written by kids, so it looks more free and less formal so it is more approchable for students. (I wanted to make the fonts as if it was a kids handwriting)   </p>

<h3><strong>(1)Subpages template wireframe:</strong></h3>
<img src="Subpages%20Wireframe%202.png" height="200px." />
<h3><strong>(1)Subpages template</strong></h3>
<ul><li><a href="subpages%20template.dwt">Dreamweaver Version</a></li></ul>
<img src= "Screen%20Shot%202015-02-26%20at%202.27.53%20PM.png" height="350px." /></a>
<p>Notes / Weaknesses of our first wireframe</p>
<ul><li>It is incomplete</li>
<li>Still need to arrange logos and the sign up form user centered</li>
<li>Sign up sheet form has to be bigger - it is too small and it is too annoying to scroll down to sign up</li>
<li>Content and sign up form can be side by side not places up and down.</li></ul>

<ul><li>Fireworks</li></ul>

<h3><strong>(2)Changed Wireframe</strong></h3>
<img src ="final%20subpage%20wireframe%20(photos).png" height="200px." />
<p>We have two different types of subpages. This wireframe is for the &quot;Photos&quot; and &quot;Service Sheets&quot; Subpages</p>
<img src ="final%20subpage%20wireframe.png" height="200px." />
<p>This wireframe is for the &quot;About&quot; and &quot;Upcoming Events&quot; Subpages</p>
<p>We made two different wireframe for our subpages because when we did it with all one wireframe it was harder to look at the subpages since the audience weren't sure if the page had changed after clicking onto a different subpage</p>
<h3><strong>(2)Changed Template</strong></h3>
<ul><li><a href="subpages%20template%20final.html">Dreamweaver Version 2 (for &quot;ABOUT&quot; and &quot;EVENTS&quot; subpages only)</a>
    </li><li><a href="subpages%20for%20photo.html">Dreamweaver Version 2 (for &quot;PHOTO&quot; and &quot;SERVICE SHEETS&quot; subpages only)</a></li>
<li><a href="file:///Users/CTD-2/Desktop/Jo%20Eun/Github/CTD-Planning-Site-JChung/hover%202.htm">FW buttons</a></li></ul>
<img src="final%20subpage%20wireframe.png" height= "300px." /></a>
<img src="final%20template.png" height="350px." /></a>
<img src="final%20subpage%20wireframe%20(photos).png" height="300px." />
<img src="Screen%20Shot%202015-03-23%20at%202.00.29%20PM.png" height="350px." />
<p>This is our Final wireframe and template made from Dreamweaver. We made some changes in our wireframe and our template considereing the advices our classmate gave. We had to arrange the size of our content and the sign up form on the subpages.Moreover, since we made the subpages too consistent in every page that it was hard to recognize if it was a different page or on the same page..So we decided to change the look of some subpages so that it is more recongnizable for our audience and client.Another problem was that we didn't know if this size of our site and the size of the sign up form would actually fit in students phone when they access through other devices to look for events. We still are working on trying to arrange little parts of our subpages so it would be completed with &quot;usercentered&quot; website.</p>

    <h4>WHAT I LEARNT NEW FROM CREATING WEBPAGES</h4>
    <p><strong>1. How to embed a website into html?</strong></p>
    <p>We can use the code iframe src= &quot;www...&quot; just like how we embed images.</p>
