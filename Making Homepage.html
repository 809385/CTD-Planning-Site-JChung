        <h1>How My HOMEPAGE was created</h1>
       
    <li><a href="htdocs/Index-FW2.htm">Firework Version</a></li>
    <li><a href="htdocs/Index-FW3.htm">Firework Version 2</a></li>
        
        <p><strong>**EVALUATION</strong></p>
        <ul><li>For the second version, I changed the format of the webpage, so it is "user focused."--->instead of clicking on to the sign up button, I reduced one click by embedding the actual sign up form inside.</li></ul>
        <p>How Fireworks is useful</p>
        <ul>
        <li>CAN slice parts when linking</li>
        <li>Gridlines help match lines</li>
        <li>Slicing helps us know which part is needed or useful and which are not</li></ul>
        
        <p>How Fireworks is not useful</p>
        <ul><li>All the slices are in images</li>
        <li>Unlike DW we need to slice the parts to link each part</li>
        <li>Canvas size is limited</li>
        </ul>
        
        
        
         <li><a href="htdocs/index-DW.htm">Dreamweaver Version</a>
        <p>How Dreamweaver is useful</p>
        <ul><li>Automatically finishes HTML code for us</li>
        <li>It is focused more on the coding</li>
        <li>CSS rules on the side</li>
        <li>Can split view - It provides both the design so we know how it looks and also provides the code so it also gives us an idea of how the code looks like.</li></ul>
        <p>How Dreamweaver is not useful</p>
        <ul><li>Unlike Fireworks where we can just choose our own fonts and colors and other elements, in dreamweaver we need to use CSS rules.</li></ul>
        <h2>Subpages</h2>
<p>TO DO list:</p>
<p>1. Objectives reviewed</p>
<p>2. Create wireframe for subpages</p>
<p>3. Create subpages template in Dreamweaver</p>
<p>4. Use the template to create individual subpages</p>
             <h3>Goals:</h3>

<h3>LOOK AND FEEL OF THE SUBPAGES</h3>
<p><strong>Why is the Look and Feel of the website important?</strong></p>
<p>It is important because it instantly conveys an attitude to clients</p>
<p>Every website has a different purpose and the look and feel of it would help this client to achieve their purpose and who their audience are.</p>
<p>It's like a "personality," which matches up with what the client wants</p>
<p><strong>A good look and feel of our website could be</strong></p>
<ul><li>Approachable</li>
<li>Friendly</li>
<li>Experienced</li>
<li>w/ some Consistent parts (Too much consistency can create confusion to the audience because they don't notice when the page is changes.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Our Final Website LOOK AND FEEL is going to be..</strong></p>
<p>Fonts:</p>
<p>Color of background: White</p>
<p>Logo: The AIS Logo will help meet the client's objective..This Logo will make the audience (AIS HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS) recognize that this is for them or not.. The students will be able to get who this site is for</p>
<p>Size: </p>
<p>Navigations: </p>
<p>Tone: It would be friendly since it is for the AIS students who are willing to help people in the community</p>


<h3><strong>(1)Subpages template wireframe:</strong></h3>
<img src="Subpages%20Wireframe%202.png" height="200px.">
<h3><strong>(1)Subpages template</strong></h3>
<ul><li>Dreamweaver</li></ul>
<img src= "Screen%20Shot%202015-02-26%20at%202.27.53%20PM.png" height="350px."></a>
<p>Notes / Weaknesses of our first wireframe</p>
<ul><li>It is incomplete</li>
<li>Still need to arrange logos and the sign up form user centered</li>
<li>Sign up sheet form has to be bigger - it is too small and it is too annoying to scroll down to sign up</li>
<li>Content and sign up form can be side by side not places up and down.</li></ul>
<h3><strong>(2)Changed Template</strong></h3>
<img src="final%20subpage%20wireframe.png" height= "300px."></a>
<img src="final%20template.png" height="350px."></a>
<p>This is our Final wireframe and template made from Dreamweaver. We made some changes in our wireframe and our template considereing the advices our classmate gave. We had to arrange the size of our content and the sign up form on the subpages.Moreover, since we made the subpages too consistent in every page that it was hard to recognize if it was a different page or on the same page..So we decided to change the look of some subpages so that it is more recongnizable for our audience and client.Another problem was that we didn't know if this size of our site and the size of the sign up form would actually fit in students phone when they access through other devices to look for events. We still are working on trying to arrange little parts of our subpages so it would be completed with "usercentered" website.</p>
