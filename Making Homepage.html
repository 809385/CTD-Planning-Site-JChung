        <h1>How My HOMEPAGE was created</h1>
       
    <li><a href="htdocs/Index-FW2.htm">Firework Version</a></li>
    <li><a href="htdocs/Index-FW3.htm">Firework Version 2</a></li>
        
        <p><strong>**EVALUATION</strong></p>
        <ul><li>For the second version, I changed the format of the webpage, so it is "user focused."--->instead of clicking on to the sign up button, I reduced one click by embedding the actual sign up form inside.</li></ul>
        <p>How Fireworks is useful</p>
        <ul>
        <li>CAN slice parts when linking</li>
        <li>Gridlines help match lines</li>
        <li>Slicing helps us know which part is needed or useful and which are not</li>
        <li>Can make buttons that could be put into dreamweaver</li></ul>
        
        <p>How Fireworks is not useful</p>
        <ul><li>All the slices are in images</li>
        <li>Unlike DW we need to slice the parts to link each part</li>
        <li>Canvas size is limited</li>
        </ul>
        
        
        
         <li><a href="htdocs/index-DW.htm">Dreamweaver Version</a>
        <p>How Dreamweaver is useful</p>
        <ul><li>Automatically finishes HTML code for us</li>
        <li>It is focused more on the coding</li>
        <li>CSS rules on the side</li>
        <li>Can split view - It provides both the design so we know how it looks and also provides the code so it also gives us an idea of how the code looks like.</li></ul>
        <p>How Dreamweaver is not useful</p>
        <ul><li>Unlike Fireworks where we can just choose our own fonts and colors and other elements, in dreamweaver we need to use CSS rules.</li></ul>

             <h2>WHAT I LEARNT NEW FROM CREATING WEBPAGES</h2>
    <p><strong>1. How to embed a website into html?</strong></p>
    <p>We can use the code iframe src= "www..." just like how we embed images.</p>
